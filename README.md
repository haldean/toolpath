toolpath will one day generate toolpaths.
==

For now, though, toolpath slices a model into slices of configurable height and
visualizes the perimeters of the slices. Run it with:

    make -j4
    ./tp path/to/model.obj

Drive the UI with WASD, Q/E for zooming, and n/p for switching between layers.
